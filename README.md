# Bone-health-and-corticosterooids-in-asthma
Databases were systematically searched to identify studies reporting on bone mineral density (BMD) measurement and risk of osteoporosis or fracture, comparing people with asthma exposed to inhaled (ICS) or oral (OCS) corticosteroids, with nonexposed people with asthma and healthy controls. Data were narratively synthesized, and a series of meta-analyses were performed using the random-effects inverse variance method.
